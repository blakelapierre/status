Regular income will allow me to:

*Pay for a place to live
*Pay for food to eat
*Pay to travel
*Pay for expenses
*Pay towards retirement funds
*Pay towards others projects/investments/needs
*Donate to others
*Eliminate stress

I don't think you should just do what anyone will pay you to do, but I also don't think that I can continue without making a regular income, or a large sum of money.


Possible income sources:

*Salaried job
*Hourly job
*Investment payouts
*Making and selling products
*Offering services
*Donations


Possible income sources from projects:

*trumporb.it
*tworb.it
*facerace/game

*dist.lol

*food/nutrition

*cloud-launcher.io

*exercise

*instantchat

*jsxbox

*trade.work


Most likely projects to choose first to attempt to generate(?) income:

*facerace/game
*dist.lol


Income models:

*Make features purchasable, but available to everyone after a certain level of income has been realized or after some time period has elapsed
  Examples:
    *dist.lol - increase ability by purchase (after 10 people buy the ability to view 4 frequency bands, everyone gets to access them)
    *game - increase allowable ability ranges (?)


*Make purchasable features shareable
  Examples:
    *game - increase base resource generation rate
            special items available

            increase "spending limit" for game "rules" (could be special items, levels, etc)
